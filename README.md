It is designed to support the creation of GIS datasets representing statistical grids based on the European ETRS89-LAEA coordinate reference system ([EPSG:3035](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/etrs89-etrs-laea/)), which are compliant with the [Census 2021 regulation](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/population-and-housing-census/background), [the INSPIRE regulation](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/id/document/tg/su) and the [GEOSTAT initiative](https://www.efgs.info/geostat/).
